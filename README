This is a presentation and code examples that I gave at the Sheffield .NET User Group on 07/06/2012. Microsoft Fakes is a new mocking library introduced in Visual Studio 2012.

The Sheffield .NET User Group meets on the first Thursday of each month at the GIST Lab in Sheffield. To find out more, follow @dotnetsheff on Twitter or see the Google group http://groups.google.com/group/dotnetsheffield.
